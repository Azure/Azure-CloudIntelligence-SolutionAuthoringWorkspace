This solution sets up the infrastructure in the diagram above. The various steps are as follows:

* Setting up an Azure WebJob to collect Twitter data based on user specified keywords.
* Pumping ingested tweets into Azure Event Hub which can accept millions of events per second.
* Processing incoming tweets with an Azure Stream Analytics job that stores the raw data in Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database.
* The Stream Analytics job calls an Azure Machine Learning web service to determine the sentiment of each tweet. 
* Visualizing real-time metrics about inferred sentiment using Time Series Insights for Operational Technology real-time monitoring and Power BI for Information Technology reporting and analysis.
