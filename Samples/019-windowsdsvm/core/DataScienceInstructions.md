### Accessing your VM

You can access your newly created Data Science VM with Remote Desktop:

* *Computer*: {Outputs.vmName}
* *URL*: {Outputs.vmUri}
* *User name*: {Outputs.adminUsername}
* *password*: {Outputs.adminPassword}

You'll notice that a file named "output10.txt" has been generated in the folder "C:\Windows\Temp." This file was generated by running the Python script "writefile.py" from the PowerShell script. 

Click [here]({Outputs.dataScienceVmUrl}) to view your DSVM on the Azure portal.
