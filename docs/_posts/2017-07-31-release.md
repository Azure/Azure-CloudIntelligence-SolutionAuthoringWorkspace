# Self-service publishing

- Members of IMML ADS org can create new solutions in the curated CIQS gallery without requesting an ID from the CIQS team.
- Publishing into Cloud Intelligence Gallery was separated from publishing into the CIQS Gallery to accelerate the launch of Solutions and Tutorials.
 
> Q: *How do I publish to CI Gallery now?*
>
> A: By navigating to [https://quickstart.azure.ai/Account/Manage](https://quickstart.azure.ai/Account/Manage)

- Adding additional contributors to a solution is no longer curated by the CIQS team. Owners can add contributors via the Manifest. For instance, by replacing this line

```xml
<Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
```

with

```xml
<Owners>
    <Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
    <Owner displayname="Bob" email="bob@microsoft.com" />
</Owners>
```

# CI Gallery contributor permissions check

In order to prevent unintentional publishing to CI Gallery not on behalf of Microsoft, we will be notifying authors without Microsoft content contributor permissions.
