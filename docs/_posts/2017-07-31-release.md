# Updated publishing workflow

We have taken further steps towards enabling truly self-service publishing:

- Authors who are part of the IMML ADS org can create new solutions in the curated CIQS gallery without requesting an ID from the CIQS team
- Publishing into Cortana Intelligence Gallery was separated from publishing into the CIQS gallery

> *Why is this good news?* Because now CIQS On-call (or a colleague with permissions) can publish your solution into the gallery right after it's been published into CIQS. Having the Gallery team to grant a new author contributor permissions can take up to 2 weeks. This reduces the time it takes to publish a new solution to CI Gallery to minutes. 

> *How do I publish to CI Gallery now?* By navigating to [https://start.cortanaintelligence.com/Account/Manage](https://start.cortanaintelligence.com/Account/Manage)

- Adding additional contributors to your solution is no longer curated by the CIQS team. Owners can add contributors via the Manifest. For instance, by replacing this line

```xml
<Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
```

with

```xml
<Owners>
    <Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
    <Owner displayname="Bob" email="bob@microsoft.com" />
<Owners>
```

# CI Gallery contributor permissions check

In order to prevent unintentional publishing to CI Gallery not on behalf of Microsoft, we have included a permissions check, which will notify authors without appropriate permissions.
