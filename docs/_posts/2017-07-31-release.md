# Updated publishing workflow

We have taken further steps towards enabling truly self-service publishing:

- Authors who are part of the IMML ADS org can create new solutions in the curated CIQS gallery without requesting an ID from the CIQS team
- Publishing into Cortana Intelligence Gallery was separated from publishing into the CIQS gallery
Why is this good news? Because now CIQS On-call (or a colleague with permissions) can publish your solution into the gallery right away instead of waiting for the Gallery team to make changes on their end (which can take up to 2 weeks, or 1 week on average). 
- Adding additional contributors to your solution is no longer curated by the CIQS team. Owners can add contributors via the Manifest. For instance:

before:

```
<Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
```

after

```
<Owners>
    <Owner displayname="Alice" email="alice@microsoft.com" />
    <Owner displayname="Bot" email="bob@microsoft.com" />
<Owners>
```
