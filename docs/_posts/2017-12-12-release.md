- Numerous bug fixes

# Long-running and secure functions

Functions used as CIQS provisioning steps timed out after about 5 minutes of execution. That was inconvenient and often
led to deployment failures.

One of the recent updates to the deployment engine removes this restriction and allows all functions,
regardless of the programming language, to run indefinitely long. In addition, Functions used as provisioning steps
no longer need to be *anonymous* (which essentially makes them publicly accessible).
In fact, they don't even need to be enabled! See [this example](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-CortanaIntelligence-SolutionAuthoringWorkspace/tree/master/Samples/004-cognitiveservices/core/functions/createWebsite)
to learn how to build more secure solutions.

# Resolution steps for recoverable ARM deployment errors

CIQS will parse ARM errors to identify potentially recoverable conditions. If appropriate, a link to 
corresponing [recovery steps](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-CortanaIntelligence-SolutionAuthoringWorkspace/blob/master/docs/faq.md)
will be shown to the user to assist them in successfully completing the deployment.
