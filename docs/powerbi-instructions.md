# How to connect to data source in Power BI desktop?
## Step 1
Download and open the sample **pbix** file. You can download Power BI desktop from [**here**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) to a Windows desktop if you donâ€™t have one.
## Step 2
**Close** any prompted dialog if you are asked for data credential, because in this tutorial we are going to change the data source and credential away from default configuration to what you have just provisioned.
## Step 3
Click "**Edit Queries**" and select "**Data source settings**".

## Step 5
From the "**Change Source...**" popup, replace the "**Server**" and "**Database**" input as the post-deployment instruction tells and leave everything else as default. for example:

Then we are ready to configure the credentials for the new data source we just added.

The "**User name**" and "**Password**" are the ones you were asked to provide in the middle of the provisioning workflow (Remember? ðŸ˜Š).

Finally, click "**Refresh**" button or the "**Apply changes**" button to load data from the data source into your report; Power BI report views with real-time streaming data is ready for you!
